## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->
A boat beneath a sunny sky  
Lingering onward dreamily  
In an evening of July--  
 Children three that nestle near,  
Eager eye and willing ear,

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem of your choice 8-20 lines,here!-->
When deeds splay before us  precious as gold & unused chances  
stripped from the whine-bone, we know the moment kindheartedness  
walks in. Each praise be echoes us back as the years uncount  
themselves, eating salt. Though blood first shaped us on the climbing wheel,  
the human mind lit by the savannaâ€™s ice star & thistle rose,  
your knowing gaze enters a room & opens the day,  
saying we were made for fun. Even the bedazzled brute know  
when sunlight falls through leaves across honed knives on the table.    
If we can see it push shadows  aside, growing closer, are we less    
broken? A barometer, temperature  gauge, a ruler in minus fractions  
& pedigrees, a thingmajig,  a probe with an all-seeing eye,  
what do we need to measurekindness, every unheld breath,    
every unkind leapyear?Sometimes a sober voice is enough    
to calm the waters & drive away  the false witnesses, saying,  
Look, here are the broken treaties Beauty  brought to us earthbound sentinels.
